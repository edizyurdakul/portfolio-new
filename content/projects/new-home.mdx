## How I worked on this project

My goal was to use firebase as a database and authentication to learn more about manipulating data from database and using authentication to build web apps.

## How to navigate this project

- Styling with Tailwind CSS, simple utility based CSS framework with HeadlessUI for UI component from the same developers of Tailwind CSS
- The application fetches data from the Firebase: Examples for the request [https://github.com/edizyurdakul/newhome/blob/main/src/pages/Home.jsx](https://github.com/edizyurdakul/newhome/blob/main/src/pages/Home.jsx)

## Why I built the project this way

- Tailwind is a great utility based css library, and Headless UI for fast component development.
- My main goal is to become a front end developer. That's why I decided to use firebase rather to create a custom backend server with database, firebase allows easier integration with databases and authentication.

## If I had more time I would change this

- Set up continuous integration to run ESLint and Husky before commiting/pushing/pulling.
- Set up testings
- Add editing for each listing, in profile page

## Available Scripts

**`npm start`**

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in your browser.

**`npm run build`**

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

Setup requires firebase.config which connects to firebase with firestore
